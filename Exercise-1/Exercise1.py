# Exercise 1. 
# some additional details. 
# In new version on python print function required curly braces.
# this # symbol used to specify the comments.
# String in python can be defined using double quotes (") or single Quote(')


print ("Hello World!") # String defined using Double Quotes
print ("Hello Again") 
print ("I like typing this.")
print ("This is fun.") 
print ('Yay! Printing.')  # String defined using single quotes
print ("I'd much rather you 'not'.") # string defined using mix
print ('I "said" do not touch this.') # string defined using mix

# with the last two lines you can easily think we can start using double quotes
# and can use single quotes in between.
