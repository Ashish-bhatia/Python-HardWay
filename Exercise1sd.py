# Exercise 1. - Study Drill
#For this exercise, try these things:

#  1) Make your script print another line.
#  2) Make your script print only one of the lines.
#  3) Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? 
#     Try to find out what this character does.


#print ("Hello World!") 
#print ("Hello Again") 
#print ("I like typing this.")
#print ("This is fun.") 
#print ('Yay! Printing.')  
#print ("I'd much rather you 'not'.") 
#print ('I "said" do not touch this.')
print('Hello I am really learning python')

# Solution :
# 1) added new print line.
# 2) use '#' character to comment the lines.
# 3) # character comments out the line it will not be executed.
